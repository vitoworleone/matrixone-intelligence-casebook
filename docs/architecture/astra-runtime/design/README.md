# Design documentation index


The design docs are organized by orthogonal ownership boundaries. If a topic appears to belong in multiple places, write the invariant in the owning domain and reference it elsewhere instead of duplicating it.

These documents describe target contracts. They should not be read as proof that the current implementation already satisfies every requirement.

## Canonical domains

## Anti-duplication rules

- Tool visibility belongs to capability system, not prompt lifecycle.
- Tool execution routing belongs to capability system, not Web Agent runner.
- Plan mode belongs to runtime lifecycle, not a separate agent architecture.
- Introspection and reflection belong to observation plane, not context pipeline.
- Prompt cache belongs to context/prompt, not provider routing.
- Model eligibility, account binding, credential placement, and billing ownership belong to model access and inference; routing only chooses among eligible Offerings.
- Edge local filesystem and shell authority belong to edge-cloud execution and safety, not Web Agent docs.
- Sync durability belongs to cloud-edge sync, not session lifecycle.
- Learning data belongs to evaluation/learning, not raw debug or audit docs.

## Deprecated document pattern

Historical implementation notes should not live in `docs/design/`. If a deleted document contained a still-valid invariant, it should now be represented in one of the canonical documents above.
