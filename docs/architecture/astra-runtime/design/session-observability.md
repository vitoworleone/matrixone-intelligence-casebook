# Session observability

> Status: target design contract.

Session observability defines how users, agents, and support tooling understand what is happening in a session without reading raw logs.

## Ownership

This document owns:

- user-visible session/run/task status;
- stream event projection semantics;
- stuck/degraded/blocked explanations;
- observability views for resume, cancel, and reconnect;
- support-grade status summaries.

It does not own raw trace schema, which belongs to [observation-plane.md](observation-plane.md).

## Principle

```text
A session should be explainable from durable projections and structured facts.
```

## Status model

A session status projection should include:

```text
session_id
active_run_id
run_status
stage
current_turn
active_task_summary
provider_status
sync_status
last_progress_at
waiting_for
blocked_reason
resumability
terminal_outcome
```

## Progress semantics

Progress should be derived from durable events:

- model round started/completed;
- tool call started/completed/failed;
- provider decision;
- retry decision;
- cache decision;
- sync status;
- task transition;
- checkpoint saved;
- stream cursor advanced.

## Stuck detection

A run may appear stuck because of:

- model TTFB;
- provider offline;
- tool timeout;
- permission wait;
- plan-mode block;
- sync degraded;
- owner lease issue;
- stream disconnect;
- task waiting for child run.

The projection should expose the specific reason and next action.

## Stream events

Stream events are transport projections of durable or near-durable facts. They should carry enough information to repair UI state after reconnect.

Tool terminal projections preserve execution facts independently of display
previews. `executed` describes this call: `false` means no execution, `true`
means execution occurred, and explicit `null` means execution cannot be
confirmed. An absent field supplies no execution fact. A `reused` disposition
can carry a receipt from an earlier execution without executing this call
again. Live delivery, replay, and size-bounded projections preserve these
distinctions. A shortened preview is not an authoritative receipt; control
identities remain exact or are explicitly omitted, never shortened into a
different identity.

Malformed non-critical stream events should be isolated when possible. Identity or cursor corruption should fail closed with structured error and should not corrupt durable run state.

## Tool results and runtime guidance

Tool result documents and runtime-authored guidance are distinct evidence.
Recovery, quality, duplicate-observation, and pre-tool context annotations must
not be appended to `ToolCallRecord.result_full`: doing so can turn complete JSON
into an invalid document and break typed consumers or artifact recovery.

The journal retains `runtime_advisories` beside the result. Canonical tool
messages retain the same per-call guidance in `_astra_tool_result_advisories`,
including across continuation and compression. Executor-provided metadata cannot
author this reserved runtime field. Guidance is rendered only on disposable
provider/display projections; projection consumes the internal marker exactly
once and canonical-suffix checks use the same projection. Model-facing content
may contain explanatory prose; the canonical result document remains unchanged.
This adds no volatile singleton, global cache prefix, or separate replay state.

Oversized guidance uses the same immutable artifact store and bounded
`introspect(artifact, offset, max_bytes)` recovery as oversized output. Artifact
identity includes the document kind: ordinary result and runtime guidance for
the same run/call cannot overwrite one another. Ordinary result handles and
paths are unchanged. Only result-kind descriptors can authorize `result_full`
or result compaction. The journal retains `runtime_advisory_artifact` beside
the bounded guidance preview; full guidance remains in that verified artifact,
not in every future prompt or journal row.

## Resume and reconnect

On reconnect, the client should rebuild from:

- latest run status;
- transcript cursor;
- task projection;
- provider status;
- sync status;
- recent trace summary;
- artifact manifest.

Browser disconnect is not cancellation.
An SSE or WebSocket send failure, malformed observation payload, or exhausted
observer read retry closes that attachment without changing durable run status.
Only an explicit authorized cancel request may cancel the run; the client can
reattach using its durable event cursor.
An internal CLI stream failure does not cancel the Server run. The local
session execution lease covers local tool execution and canonical partial
commit; after those finish, it is released with the request. A still-active
remote run remains protected by Server session-slot admission. An unconfirmed
local execution or failed owner cleanup is not treated as a clean stream
failure and retains its local exclusion until its own authority settles.

Transcript progress is described by item sequence and committed cursor.
Physical page counts, page high watermarks, and page lag are not exposed.
The committed projection may honestly lag canonical context until its evidence
has been materialized and the contiguous cursor promoted.

## User-facing diagnostics

A user should be able to answer:

- Is it running, blocked, waiting, cancelled, or complete?
- What is it waiting for?
- Is Edge/CLI/server/MCP provider available?
- Did sync finish?
- Can I resume, retry, reconnect, or cancel?
- What changed since last visible output?

## Test obligations

- Offline provider produces visible blocked/degraded status.
- Malformed stream cursor does not corrupt active run state.
- Browser disconnect does not imply cancellation.
- Cancelled tasks disappear from active task board projection.
- Resume reconstructs status without stale UI cache.
