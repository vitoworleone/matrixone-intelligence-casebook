# Feedback control loop

> Status: target design contract.

The feedback control loop turns user feedback, trace facts, eval results, and operational signals into controlled product improvement. It is the upstream system for tuning jobs and evaluation.

## Principles

- Feedback is evidence, not automatic truth.
- Negative feedback must preserve context and provider decisions.
- Implicit feedback requires conservative interpretation.
- Improvement proposals must pass evaluation before activation.
- Feedback must respect privacy, consent, and deletion.

## Feedback sources

| Source | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| Explicit user feedback | thumbs up/down, correction, comment, bug report. |
| Behavioral feedback | user undoes change, retries prompt, abandons run. |
| Tool feedback | malformed call, repeated failure, fallback, timeout. |
| Evaluation feedback | regression failure, rubric score, human label. |
| Operational feedback | latency, token waste, sync degraded, provider offline. |

## Feedback record

A feedback record should include:

```text
feedback_id
user_id/session_id/run_id/turn_id
source
sentiment_or_score
target_type
target_id
context_refs
provider_decision_refs
privacy_scope
created_at
```

## Interpretation

Feedback interpretation should classify:

- prompt issue;
- tool/capability issue;
- provider routing issue;
- memory/context issue;
- model choice issue;
- product UX issue;
- user/environment issue;
- unsafe or policy issue.

## Control loop

```text
collect -> classify -> aggregate -> propose -> evaluate -> approve -> activate -> monitor
```

Activation is handled through tuning jobs or explicit product changes, not directly from raw feedback.

## Guardrails

- Do not overfit to a single complaint without evidence.
- Do not use sensitive raw data without consent.
- Do not treat low-confidence implicit feedback as a hard label.
- Do not activate a change without rollback.

## Next-turn assessment collection

The existing semantic admission judges own optional response satisfaction and new-task
difficulty/urgency observations. Their canonical source message, uncertainty,
response-reference rules, collection coverage, and training leakage constraints
are specified in [model-routing.md](model-routing.md#next-turn-observations-stage-2).
These observations supplement objective/task verification; they are not success
verdicts and do not activate routing or learning policies.
