# Capability provider runtime

> Status: target design contract.

This document defines Astra's protocol-independent provider, tool identity,
discovery snapshot, invocation, and typed outcome contracts. It is a detailed
sub-contract of [capability-system.md](capability-system.md).

The current implementation does not yet satisfy every requirement here. Active
implementation phases and findings are tracked outside canonical design docs.

## Ownership

This document owns:

- provider adapter and discovery snapshot boundaries;
- stable internal capability/tool identity;
- resolved descriptor and model projection separation;
- provider-claim provenance and semantic resolution;
- per-invocation policy inputs and identity;
- provider dispatch certainty and typed call outcomes;
- the boundary between invocation deduplication, semantic result caching, and
  prompt caching;
- cross-provider conformance and unhappy-path invariants.

It does not own:

- detailed permission rules, owned by
  [safety-and-permissions.md](safety-and-permissions.md);
- provider selection and fallback priority, owned by
  [capability-system.md](capability-system.md);
- session/run recovery policy, owned by
  [runtime-lifecycle.md](runtime-lifecycle.md) and
  [durable-agent-runs.md](durable-agent-runs.md);
- prompt construction and cache placement, owned by
  [prompt-lifecycle.md](prompt-lifecycle.md);
- artifact retention and debug bundles, owned by
  [artifacts-and-debug-bundles.md](artifacts-and-debug-bundles.md);
- runtime authority, owned by
  [edge-runtime-tool-boundary.md](edge-runtime-tool-boundary.md).

## Core contract

```text
provider adapter → lossless discovery snapshot
        ↓ validate, normalize, and content-address
resolved provider snapshot + internal identity/descriptor
        ├─ deterministic model/context projection
        └─ per-invocation policy resolution
                         ↓
                durable invocation ledger
                         ↓
                  provider execution
                         ↓
                  typed result envelope
```

Projection, admission, permission, scheduling, execution, retry, caching,
recording, resume, replay, and diagnostics must refer to the same resolved
descriptor and provider decision.

Static and dynamic describe how a declaration enters Astra. They do not create
different execution semantics.

## First principles

### Astra owns semantics; protocols supply evidence

External protocols, local registries, and Edge runtimes supply declarations,
claims, and call outcomes. Astra owns identity, trust, admission, policy,
durability, projection, and recovery.

A provider field may inform policy. It does not become policy merely because it
arrived on the wire.

### Identity precedes naming and projection

Internal identity is the provider binding plus native capability identity. An
exact descriptor version identifies the declaration Astra resolved.

Public tool names, model schemas, prompt order, and client labels are
deterministic projections. They are not durable execution or replay keys.

Deferred selection records learned contract knowledge, not a permanent lease on
an executor process. Before a new model request, an already resolved selection
may bind to the current admitted provider when its compact selection digest,
native tool identity, and provider descriptor version are unchanged. A missing
descriptor, changed contract, hidden capability, or unavailable provider cannot
be repaired from a name alone. After that request's projection, provider changes
must still fail invocation admission and durable dispatch; post-response policy
refresh must not rebind selected execution identities. Resident schema bytes and
durable invocation/replay keys are unaffected by this request-bound revalidation.

Semantic topology settlement must not rewrite a deferred declaration's action
schema after `tool_search` has issued its selection digest in that request.
Keep discovery contract identity stable and enforce the settled topology at
invocation admission. A discoverable `agent_fanout.start` does not authorize
parallel execution: serial admission permits only an exact one-slot fanout,
and an authoritative parallel admission rejects a direct single-agent substitute.
Capability and provider restrictions continue to apply independently.


### One fact source

Visibility and execution must originate from the same resolved provider
snapshot. Independent name lists, effect maps, routing maps, and cache maps are
semantic shadow systems and are forbidden.

### Effect, idempotency, and invocation identity are orthogonal

- Effect describes which state or authority domain a call may affect.
- Idempotency describes whether replaying an operation is semantically safe.
- Invocation identity describes whether two deliveries are the same logical
  call.

Equal names and arguments do not imply equal invocation identity. A pure read
may become stale, an idempotent write may still require permission, and an
external mutation may be intentionally repeated.

### Failure is typed and scoped

Provider tool failure, rejection, transport failure, protocol failure, and
ambiguous dispatch are different outcomes. They must not be rediscovered from
human-readable strings.

A malformed tool should be isolated at the smallest safe boundary. A local
declaration error must not silently disable unrelated provider capabilities.

### Optimizations never become authority

Prompt caching, semantic read-result caching, batching, and compaction may
change latency or cost. They must not grant authority, fabricate success,
collapse distinct intent, or determine whether a session can continue.

## Plane ownership

| Plane | Owns | Must not own |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Provider adapter | Protocol/auth transport, lossless discovery decoding, native call encoding/decoding | Astra permission, retry, cache, prompt, or result policy |
| Resolution | Immutable provider snapshot, internal identity, normalized claims, schema/version validation | Per-call mutable state |
| Decision | Admission, permission, concurrency, retry, cache, route, projection policy | Provider-specific parsing |
| Execution/durability | Invocation state machine, dispatch, typed outcome, reconciliation | Model/client presentation conventions |
| Context/projection | Public aliases, model schemas, prompt-cache zones, resource/result projections | Execution truth |
| Observation | Decision/outcome lineage, cost, cache and degraded facts | Alternate control flow or silent recovery |

Dependencies flow downward. Adapters provide declarations and typed outcomes;
they do not call back into core policy. Projection consumes resolved facts and
never becomes the source used for execution.

## Provider adapters and typed facets

General infrastructure does not mean one untyped
`execute(Value) -> Value` interface. Identity, binding, snapshotting,
provenance, health, and diagnostics are shared. Tools, resources, skills,
prompts, and models retain typed facets where lifecycle and safety differ.

Conceptually:

```rust
trait ProviderAdapter {
    async fn discover(&self, binding: &ProviderBinding)
        -> Result<ProviderDiscoverySnapshot, ProviderError>;
}

trait ToolExecutionAdapter: ProviderAdapter {
    async fn execute(&self, invocation: &ProviderInvocation)
        -> Result<ProviderCallOutcome, ProviderError>;
}

trait ResourceAccessAdapter: ProviderAdapter {
    async fn list_resources(&self, query: &ResourceQuery)
        -> Result<ResourcePage, ProviderError>;
    async fn read_resource(&self, request: &ResourceReadRequest)
        -> Result<ProviderResourceOutcome, ProviderError>;
}
```

A provider may implement one or several facets. The resolved provider snapshot
composes them without erasing their types.

Adapters must:

- preserve relevant protocol declarations and typed outcomes;
- redact credentials from errors, traces, and persistent projections;
- attach source/protocol provenance to claims;
- expose capability/version changes deterministically;
- distinguish acknowledged tool failure from protocol/transport failure;
- report execution dispatch certainty when a call fails outside an
  acknowledged tool result.

Adapters must not:

- decide approval, retry, semantic caching, batching, or prompt placement;
- convert missing claims into optimistic semantics;
- turn execution errors into success-shaped output;
- silently route through a different provider;
- use a model-facing alias as native identity.

## Discovery and resolution

### Lossless discovery snapshot

```rust
struct ProviderDiscoverySnapshot {
    provider_identity: ProviderIdentity,
    binding_ref: ProviderBindingRef,
    protocol_capabilities: ProtocolCapabilities,
    tool_declarations: Vec<ProviderToolDeclaration>,
    resource_declarations: Vec<ProviderResourceDeclaration>,
    content_hash: String,
}
```

The snapshot contains decoded declarations and claim provenance, not final
Astra policy. Credentials and transport secrets are references owned by the
binding layer, never snapshot content.

Snapshot construction must:

- reject empty provider, binding, and native identities;
- canonicalize schema/object serialization;
- sort by stable internal identity, never discovery response or hash-map order;
- reject duplicate native identities within one binding;
- preserve optional versus explicitly false claims;
- derive versions/hashes from semantic content, not timestamps or process IDs;
- exclude volatile health samples and call statistics from descriptor hashes.

### Provider claims

Claims retain their origin:

```rust
struct ProviderClaim<T> {
    value: T,
    source: ProviderClaimSource,
}

struct ProviderToolClaims {
    read_only: Option<ProviderClaim<bool>>,
    destructive: Option<ProviderClaim<bool>>,
    idempotent: Option<ProviderClaim<bool>>,
    open_world: Option<ProviderClaim<bool>>,
}
```

Trust is assigned by Astra's resolver from binding authority, protocol,
deployment, policy, and source provenance. An adapter cannot declare its own
claims trusted.

Missing claims remain missing. Unknown extension values are not coerced to a
known class. Contradictory claims produce an explicit malformed or conservative
resolution according to policy, with a diagnostic attached to the affected
descriptor.

### Resolved provider snapshot

One resolver transforms discovery into a content-addressed
`ResolvedProviderSnapshot`. It owns:

- validated internal identities;
- normalized declarations and schema hashes;
- claim trust and resolution reasons;
- semantic baselines;
- deterministic model/client alias projection;
- provider/binding/route references;
- admission and degraded facts.

No provider adapter constructs final permission, retry, or cache policy.

## Tool identity and descriptor references

```rust
struct ToolIdentity {
    provider_binding: ProviderBindingRef,
    native_tool_id: String,
}

struct ResolvedToolDescriptorRef {
    identity: ToolIdentity,
    descriptor_version: String,
}

struct ResolvedToolDescriptor {
    identity: ToolIdentity,
    native_tool_name: String,
    input_schema: Value,
    output_schema: Option<Value>,
    schema_hash: String,
    provider_snapshot: ResolvedProviderSnapshotRef,
    claims: ProviderToolClaims,
    semantic_baseline: ResolvedToolSemantics,
    descriptor_version: String,
}
```

`ToolIdentity` remains stable when a public alias changes. A descriptor version
changes when the declaration or relevant resolved semantics change.

Model-facing projection is separate:

```rust
struct ModelToolProjection {
    public_name: String,
    descriptor: ResolvedToolDescriptorRef,
    model_schema: Value,
}
```

When a model emits a public tool name, Astra resolves it once through the exact
projection snapshot and records the descriptor reference in the invocation.
Permission, execution, retry, recording, resume, and replay never look the tool
up again by a bare name.

Alias collisions must not select an arbitrary route. The affected projection
is deterministically namespaced or rejected before the model can invoke it.

## Semantic baseline and invocation policy

The descriptor stores primitive claims and a resolved semantic baseline with
trust and rationale. Policy is derived again per invocation because arguments,
mode, authority, workspace state, and provider health may matter.

```rust
struct ResolvedInvocationPolicy {
    descriptor: ResolvedToolDescriptorRef,
    provider_decision: ProviderDecisionRef,
    admission: AdmissionStatus,
    route: ToolExecutionRoute,
    classification: ToolClassification,
    approval: ApprovalPolicy,
    concurrency: ConcurrencyPolicy,
    retry: RetryPolicy,
    semantic_cache: SemanticCachePolicy,
    result_projection: ResultProjectionPolicy,
}
```

Batching, permission, retry, semantic caching, execution, and recording consume
this one object. Derived booleans such as `is_read_only`, `parallelizable`, and
`cacheable` must not be independently recomputed downstream.

Conservative resolution for missing or insufficient metadata is explicit:

```text
effect             = mutating/unknown
idempotency        = non-idempotent
concurrency        = serial
approval           = required according to authority/risk policy
semantic cache     = disabled
diagnostic         = metadata_missing_or_unknown
```

This fallback keeps the capability visible when safe while refusing to invent
stronger guarantees.

## Invocation identity and duplicate control

Three mechanisms are separate:

| Mechanism | Identity | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Invocation delivery deduplication | owner/session/run/turn/invocation ID | Prevent duplicate delivery/execution of the same logical call |
| Semantic read-result cache | descriptor + canonical args + freshness context | Optionally reuse a fresh successful pure-read result |
| Repetition/stall policy | sequence of distinct invocation IDs and observations | Detect likely model loops without collapsing user intent |

Prompt caching is a fourth, unrelated optimization owned by prompt lifecycle.
A prompt-cache key is never an invocation or semantic result-cache key.

Equal names and arguments with different invocation IDs are distinct calls.
The same invocation ID across retry/reconnect/resume returns its durable state
or terminal outcome.

In the headless runtime path, the in-process replay cache is restricted to the
same complete owner/session/run/turn-chain/invocation identity. A retry of that
completed invocation reuses its original outcome; a different invocation ID
executes normally even when its tool name and arguments are identical. If the
identity is incomplete, this replay cache is bypassed. The headless path does
not treat a process-local workspace epoch as proof that a prior read result is
fresh: the epoch only scopes within-batch duplicate-call counting, and writes
start a new counting window. A distinct invocation therefore follows the
ordinary execution, audit, and resource-accounting path. This may perform more
normal work than an earlier incorrect cross-invocation short circuit; it is
not a zero-cost optimization claim. Database-cost acceptance must measure the
canonical path and must not be achieved by skipping required accounting.

Semantic read caching requires enough freshness context:

```text
provider decision
tool identity and descriptor/schema version
canonical public arguments hash
workspace/resource/provider revision or ETag
policy/context snapshot version where relevant
```

Only successful typed pure-read outcomes are eligible. Errors, timeouts,
rejections, and unknown outcomes are never cached as success.

The durable invocation decision freezes cache eligibility and the exact policy
and descriptor versions, but it does not freeze a resource revision as current
truth. Freshness facts are transient evidence and must be resolved again for
every delivery attempt, including resume of an existing `Prepared` invocation.
A restored checkpoint, a serialized cache key, or a process-local mutation
counter is not proof that the current workspace/resource still has the same
revision.

A cache hit may complete a prepared invocation only when the observation's
full key exactly matches the key built from current evidence. Matching only
tool, arguments, and policy is insufficient. A newly executed read may be
published as an observation only when one of these conditions holds:

- the provider executed a conditional read bound to the claimed revision; or
- Astra resolves the same freshness key again after the provider outcome and
  before publication.

If revalidation changes, fails, or becomes unavailable, Astra retains the
durable invocation result but abandons the cache fill. This is an observable
uncached/degraded path, not a tool failure and not a session stop.

Production adapters must negotiate this as one atomic capability, not as
independent cache and transport switches. For the Astra MCP extension:

- a provider-authorized runtime capability descriptor names the exact native
  tools covered by `astra-semantic-read-mcp-v1`; model-facing aliases and
  provider self-declarations cannot grant this authority;
- Astra calls the side-effect-free `astra/semantic-read/prepare` method with
  canonical public arguments and receives raw revision facts plus an opaque
  protocol/token precondition;
- the resulting content-addressed condition is attached to the exact
  `tools/call` request under `_meta.astra.semantic_read_condition`;
- the provider returns `_meta.astra.semantic_read_condition_ack` confirming
  that exact condition. Astra validates and consumes the acknowledgement
  before events or durable result persistence; all other raw provider metadata
  remains non-authoritative and is only represented by a bounded summary.

Malformed evidence, transport failure, missing or mismatched acknowledgement,
and unsupported providers all execute the underlying read uncached. They do
not publish an observation, fabricate freshness, or stop the session. Standard
MCP remains explicitly disabled because its annotations do not define this
conditional revision contract.

Freshness preparation has its own short end-to-end deadline, including response
body consumption, so a cache optimization cannot inherit the provider tool's
execution timeout. Its timeout is side-effect-free and therefore certain. In
contrast, transport failure after a real tool request may have been sent is
`OutcomeUnknown`; an explicit JSON-RPC provider error remains an acknowledged
failure. Retry policy must preserve that distinction.

## Durable invocation ledger

```text
Prepared
   │ durable intent recorded
   ▼
Dispatched
   ├──────────────► Succeeded
   ├──────────────► Failed
   ├──────────────► Rejected
   └──────────────► OutcomeUnknown
```

The ledger records:

- owner/session/run/turn/invocation identity;
- exact descriptor and provider decision references;
- canonical arguments hash;
- resolved effect/idempotency policy;
- provider idempotency key, if any;
- state, attempts, timestamps, result/error reference;
- dispatch certainty and reconciliation state.

Execution rules:

- persist `Prepared` before dispatch;
- resolve an existing invocation identity from hot or retained archive
  evidence independently of current run executability, so terminal outcomes
  remain deterministically replayable after closure and resume;
- serialize creation of a new identity with the run closure boundary;
- use a compare-and-set transition so concurrent workers cannot dispatch one
  invocation twice;
- revalidate run executability under the same durable closure lock and
  transaction as `Prepared -> Dispatched`; prior admission is not authority to
  cross the provider boundary after the run closes;
- persist the terminal typed result before exposing durable success;
- retry idempotent work only when the downstream contract makes it safe;
- never retry a non-idempotent call after ambiguous dispatch;
- represent a lost acknowledgement after possible external application as
  `OutcomeUnknown`;
- at an independent execution edge, acquire a separate execution permit and
  persist `Running` in one WAL sync before crossing the local executor
  boundary. The execution generation remains fixed while reconnect may update
  the delivery/ACK generation; restored `Running` becomes `OutcomeUnknown`
  and is never implicitly redispatched;
- keep the independent Edge inbox/outbox crash-safe with a bounded append-only
  WAL and periodic atomic snapshots. Capacity exhaustion is an explicit
  retryable `NotDispatched` admission result, not a fabricated tool outcome;
  the rejection carries bounded journal occupancy/capacity evidence and the
  Edge logs the same structured status;
- every Server-to-Edge path creates or verifies the same durable dispatch row
  before socket delivery. Existing terminal evidence replays without another
  socket send, owner/payload conflicts fail loudly, callers are released only
  after result persistence, and the Edge drops evidence only after the exact
  ACK generation;
- connection and registry cleanup are generation-fenced. Result convergence
  uses one shared bounded batch poller (with same-pod completion wakeup), not
  one independent database polling loop per invocation;
- reconcile terminal runs before archival: zero-attempt `Prepared` becomes a
  typed, non-dispatched run-closure rejection; expired or malformed dispatched
  leases become `OutcomeUnknown`; a valid live dispatch lease remains active
  until completion or expiry;
- scan terminal runs through a durable keyset cursor so a bounded page of
  non-quiescent runs cannot starve later runs after restart or leader change;
- record reconciliation and first-observed active-lease deferral as durable
  owner-scoped events without emitting one warning per maintenance interval;
- reconcile through the provider when supported; otherwise expose uncertainty
  and require an explicit decision.

Without downstream idempotency or reconciliation, Astra cannot guarantee
strict exactly-once external effects across the remote-apply/local-ack crash
window. The product contract must state the achievable guarantee.

## Typed provider and runtime outcomes

An acknowledged provider call has a typed outcome:

```rust
enum ProviderCallOutcome {
    Success(ProviderCallPayload),
    ToolFailure(ProviderCallPayload),
    Rejected(ProviderRejection),
}
```

Provider execution errors outside an acknowledged tool result include dispatch
certainty:

```text
NotDispatched
MayHaveDispatched
```

The runtime maps these facts into its durable outcome state. It does not infer
failure from words such as `error` in output text.
When a tool may have applied an effect but its acknowledgement is lost, the
provider reports `tool_outcome_unknown` with `retryable=false`. Recovery
guidance requires reconciliation of the provider state or invocation receipt
before any new call that could repeat the effect, even if the connection has
already recovered.
An acknowledged JSON-RPC error remains a known failure with its error code and
details; a successful RPC response with `isError=true` remains a tool failure.
CLI result advertisements retain the MCP binding verified at dispatch time.
Connection recovery changes availability for later invocations, not the binding
or uncertainty of the result already being reported.

The runtime result envelope preserves:

```text
invocation and descriptor/provider decision references
typed outcome and error kind
retryability and dispatch certainty
bounded visible summary and structured preview
owner-bound raw artifact reference
content hash and original size
quality and redaction status
duration and cache/replay provenance
```

Large raw results are stored once as owner-bound artifacts when policy permits.
Model, client, trace, and learning surfaces receive bounded projections derived
from the same envelope. A client event limit applies to the entire event, not a
few known fields.

Persisting the required raw result is part of the durable result contract. If
artifact materialization fails after the provider has acknowledged an outcome,
the invocation is recorded as a non-retryable durability failure with
`NotDispatched` false and provider acknowledgement preserved; Astra must not
record a truncated projection as a successful, complete result or retry a
possibly effectful provider call.

Artifact reachability has one durable edge authority. Invocation completion
owns result-artifact edges by invocation identity. Ledger compaction transfers
those edges transactionally to the retained run archive before deleting hot
rows; archive expiry releases every run-owned edge before ordinary artifact GC
may reclaim content. A reference prevents collection while it exists but does
not silently extend or rewrite the artifact's retention policy. Forward and
reverse edge queries must expose exactly which durable owner keeps an artifact
reachable.

Introspect and reflect project, but never control, these durable facts. The
runtime introspect evidence includes hot state counts, non-dispatched closure
rejections, outcome-unknown rows, archive chunks, artifact-reference counts,
reconciliation/deferred events, and compaction cursor progress. Reflect keeps
the lifecycle events in its durable evidence graph even when they are not
children of a context decision.

## Resource context

A complete provider-resource subsystem must normalize provider resources,
request attachments, catalog files, and authoring resources into a typed,
versioned, owner-scoped resource manifest.

The complete manifest is durable and addressable. Prompt projection is bounded
by aggregate encoded-byte/token budget and includes manifest identity, version,
hash, counts, deterministic entries, `has_more`, and a list/search/read path.

This avoids both failure extremes:

- silent truncation that loses resource identity;
- unbounded request-controlled prompt growth.

Replay records the exact manifest and projected entry set the model saw.

That target contract must not be simulated by an in-memory helper. The current
production boundary is narrower and is named accordingly: each LLM attempt
records content-addressed evidence only for governed tool-result artifacts that
actually occur in that attempt. Collection retains at most 64 valid unique
entries and records observed, omitted, and invalid counts; one malformed or
overflowing reference never discards the other evidence. The evidence is
stored inline with the context manifest and does not publish a fake locator,
page, search, or read API. A general resource manifest becomes real only when
ingestion, durable lookup, authorization, paging, and prompt projection share
one production authority.

## Local session fork boundary

A local fork is not a portable session snapshot. Fork creation freezes
immutable transcript, workspace, and eligible checkpoint bytes, records their
canonical local paths and hashes in a content-addressed fork-basis evidence
file, and verifies both the frozen bytes and active child files before the
child can be activated. Task, artifact, invocation, and memory dimensions stay
explicit gaps until they have real immutable materialization semantics. Task
copying is a post-basis child-state transition, not evidence that task state was
part of the fork cursor.

This local evidence is owned by the session-fork domain, not the edge/cloud
sync wire protocol. Cross-machine synchronization or migration requires a
separate portable manifest, common as-of transaction, transfer/materialization
consumer, and restore verification; local paths and explicit gaps must never be
presented as that capability.

## Prompt-cache interaction

Prompt caching is derived from deterministic context/tool projection and never
controls capability semantics.

- always-load schemas form a canonical stable prefix;
- dynamic/deferred schemas form a deterministic controlled tail;
- current resource projections, health, task state, counters, memory,
  reflection, and tool evidence remain volatile;
- real prompt, policy, authorization, descriptor, schema, or serialization
  changes invalidate the affected cache region;
- cache unsupported, miss, or write failure changes cost/latency only;
- provider fallback rebuilds the provider-native request and never reuses an
  incompatible cache identity.

See [prompt-lifecycle.md](prompt-lifecycle.md) for cache boundary and provider
serialization details.

## Failure containment

| Failure | Required behavior |
| --- | --- |
| One declaration has malformed metadata/schema | Isolate or conservatively resolve that declaration; keep unrelated valid capabilities |
| Discovery transport/auth/protocol fails | Provider degraded/unavailable with reason; never silent permanent absence |
| Claims missing or contradictory | Explicit conservative/malformed resolution with provenance |
| Tool projected but descriptor/route unavailable | Invalid invariant; block execution and emit decision mismatch |
| Provider returns typed tool error | Record failure; never reuse as successful result |
| Dispatch may have occurred | `OutcomeUnknown`; reconcile or request explicit decision |
| Resource projection exceeds budget | Durable full manifest plus bounded projection/reference |
| Artifact persistence fails for large output | Preserve typed outcome, mark raw evidence unavailable/degraded, keep event bounded |
| Client disconnects | Durable execution continues; reconnect replays durable bounded projections |
| Prompt/result cache unavailable | Continue correct uncached execution and expose cache state |

Fallback is never silent. A fallback provider requires a new observable
provider decision and must preserve the requested authority and result
contract.

## Observability

Trace, introspection, and durable audit must expose, with redaction:

```text
provider identity, binding and snapshot version/hash
internal tool identity and descriptor version/hash
public projection alias and projection snapshot
claim sources, trust and semantic resolution reason
provider decision and resolved invocation policy
invocation identity, ledger state and attempt
dispatch certainty and reconciliation state
typed outcome/error and result/artifact references
prompt/result cache state and invalidation reason
degraded, quarantine and fallback facts
```

Observation records decisions and outcomes. It must not implement alternate
fallback, retry, or cache control flow.

## Required invariants and tests

### Unit and property tests

- Equivalent discovery inputs produce byte-identical canonical snapshots and
  hashes independent of response/map order.
- Empty/duplicate native identities and invalid schemas fail deterministically.
- Public alias changes do not redefine internal identity.
- Descriptor/schema/claim changes produce a new descriptor/snapshot version.
- Optional, false, unknown, and contradictory claims remain distinguishable.
- Every claim combination resolves deterministically and conservatively.
- Result failure is determined by typed outcome, never output prose.
- Cache keys include the correct identity and freshness dimensions.
- Whole model/client projections remain within their assigned bounds for
  arbitrary UTF-8 and nested payloads.

### Adapter conformance

Standard MCP, built-in, Edge, and at least one extension-bearing fake adapter
must satisfy one suite:

- lossless relevant declaration conversion;
- deterministic snapshot construction;
- public alias collision handling;
- typed success/tool-failure preservation;
- protocol/transport error classification and dispatch certainty;
- malformed sibling isolation;
- reconnect and declaration-change behavior;
- secret redaction.

### Integration and fault injection

- Projection, admission, permission, route, execution, and recording use one
  provider decision and descriptor reference.
- A public-name call resolves once and remains bound across later discovery
  changes, resume, and replay.
- Equal arguments with distinct invocation IDs execute distinctly.
- Retry/reconnect with the same invocation ID returns one durable outcome.
- Faults before dispatch, after dispatch, after provider application, after
  acknowledgement, and before persistence produce the required ledger state.
- A malformed tool does not remove a valid sibling.
- Resource manifests and raw results remain owner-isolated and recoverable
  while prompt/client projections remain bounded.
- Prompt/result cache failures never consume an agent round or stop a session.

## Non-goals

- No protocol/provider-specific semantic shadow map in generic runtime code.
- No strict exactly-once claim without downstream idempotency/reconciliation.
- No unbounded prompt or client result surface.
- No prose-based error inference where typed facts exist.
- No silent provider fallback, cached success, context truncation, or tool
  disappearance.
- No lowest-common-denominator capability API that erases typed tool/resource
  lifecycle and safety semantics.
- No compatibility constraint from a current provider upgrade path may define
  Astra's canonical internal model.
