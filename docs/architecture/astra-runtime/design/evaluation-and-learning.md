# Learning pipeline

> Status: target design contract.

Learning pipeline defines how Astra converts approved runtime evidence into durable learning artifacts. Evaluation, feedback, and tuning are upstream systems; learning owns consent, redaction, quality, lineage, dataset construction, and deletion propagation.

## Ownership

This document owns:

- C5 learning artifact semantics;
- consent and privacy boundary;
- redaction and quality gate requirements;
- dataset lineage;
- deletion propagation;
- activation boundary between data and behavior.

It does not own:

- evaluation case execution, owned by [evaluation.md](evaluation.md);
- feedback collection and classification, owned by [feedback-control-loop.md](feedback-control-loop.md);
- candidate improvement lifecycle, owned by [tuning-jobs.md](tuning-jobs.md);
- raw debug bundles, owned by [observation-plane.md](observation-plane.md).

## Principle

```text
Runtime traces are evidence. They become learning data only after consent, redaction, quality, and lineage gates.
```

## Allowed sources

Allowed by default when policy permits:

- explicit user feedback;
- redacted transcript excerpts;
- C2 audit facts;
- C3 trace facts;
- eval labels;
- tool-result quality annotations.

Opt-in only:

- raw debug bundles;
- private workspace snippets;
- sensitive external API results;
- raw tool output containing user data;
- personally identifying or regulated data.

## Learning artifact

A learning artifact should record:

```text
artifact_id
source_refs
consent_scope
redaction_version
quality_score
dataset_id
target_use
lineage
created_at
expires_at
```

## Dataset lifecycle

```text
candidate -> redacted -> quality_checked -> approved -> active -> deprecated -> deleted
```

A dataset must be invalidated or rebuilt when source consent is revoked or source data is deleted.

## Quality gate

Learning data must be filtered for:

- task relevance;
- correctness or label confidence;
- safety compliance;
- duplication;
- provider/tool failure contamination;
- private data leakage;
- prompt injection contamination.

## Activation boundary

Datasets do not change runtime behavior by themselves. Behavior changes go through tuning jobs, evaluation gates, and rollout/rollback policy.

## Offline routing artifacts

The implemented stage-4 router importer lives under the existing evaluation
owner and enforces explicit per-owner source-hash approvals, redaction revision,
expiry, lineage, outcome separation and related-group time splits. It exports
only typed structural evidence and produces offline candidates, with no
production activation. It does not reuse the session-summary exporter as a
routing corpus. Approved local evidence/authorization files are operator
attestations; automatic consent collection and deletion of already exported
files are not implemented. Operators must invalidate those files through their
source lineage when consent is revoked. Router lineage includes the containing
envelope and referenced feedback, execution, verifier evidence and replay
snapshot IDs. Explicit dependency revocations invalidate containing envelopes
and exported datasets even when their top-level approvals remain present. See
[model-routing.md](model-routing.md#offline-router-datasets-and-candidates-stage-4)
and the [offline workflow](../guides/model-router-offline.md).

Router candidates now have a preregistered qualification and offline shadow
workflow. The gate uses current source authorization, held-out independent-group
comparisons, prespecified strata and conservative paired quality/cost bounds.
Unknown/incomplete groups remain in coverage denominators. Passing qualifies only
for observational scoring; production qualification remains false. Services owns
the tuning record, and turn-core shares the trainer, grouping and baseline policy.
See [the routing contract](model-routing.md#qualification-and-offline-shadow-scoring-stage-5)
for assumptions, rejection conditions and remaining rollout prerequisites.
