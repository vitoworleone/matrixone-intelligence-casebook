# Memory

> Status: target design contract.

Memory owns durable knowledge across and within sessions. Context injection uses memory, but memory lifecycle, provenance, confidence, and deletion belong here.

## Memory classes

| Class | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Working memory | Current turn/session scratch state. |
| Episodic memory | Past session events and outcomes. |
| Semantic memory | Durable facts and concepts. |
| Procedural memory | Reusable procedures, preferences, and skills. |
| Project memory | Workspace/repository-specific facts. |

## Requirements

- Every memory item has provenance.
- Confidence and freshness are explicit.
- Conflicts are represented, not silently overwritten.
- User deletion propagates to derived memory.
- Memory used in a response is traceable.
- Memory injection is bounded by context budget and task relevance.

## User-requested retention

Acknowledging a fact supplied in the conversation does not require lookup or
persistence. A request to retain user facts or preferences requires a successful
memory write before the assistant claims storage. Conversation-only scope and
explicit tool bans remain authoritative; they do not grant permission to persist.
If persistence was requested but cannot be performed under those constraints,
the assistant must distinguish acknowledgment from an actual stored memory.
A write receipt proves storage, not a later-session recall that has not run.

## Loading policy

Memory loading is intent-driven:

- current task determines candidate memories;
- recent session facts outrank old memory on conflict;
- procedural memory should be loaded at point of use;
- low-confidence memory should be marked as uncertain;
- sensitive memory follows permission and redaction policy.

## Backend boundary

The design does not require one physical backend. Vector, fulltext, graph, tabular, or MCP-backed memory can coexist as long as they satisfy the same provenance, confidence, deletion, and trace contract.

## Credential authority and admission

The Server composes one per-user memory authority policy. Prompt recall, background extraction, explicit `memory` tools, HTTP memory routes and session-end governance must use that same policy.

Hosted or browser-login deployments use the application-scoped credential resolver owned by authentication. Each operation resolves the current owner binding and generation; no master-key fallback is inferred by a generic pool builder.

- Missing binding or `none`: normal disabled state. Prompt recall reports `NotAttempted` and does not contact Memoria.
- `read_only`: recall is allowed; write-oriented extraction, reflection and session-end cleanup are not admitted.
- `read_write`: read and write operations are allowed. Transport checks remain in place to catch revocation or changes after admission.

Consent denials in explicit tools and HTTP routes point to Memoria Settings → Connected apps → Astra Cloud → Memory sharing settings. They distinguish disabled sharing from read-only write denial and do not prescribe `/login` or a deployment master key as a hosted-user remedy. Missing server wiring reports a configuration problem for the administrator; local execution retains its deployment-specific configuration guidance.

Trusted self-hosted deployments may explicitly enable `MEMORIA_SELF_HOSTED_MASTER_ACCESS=1` with `MEMORIA_MASTER_KEY` and no `MEMORIA_WEB_URL`. A persisted scoped binding always wins, preserving its owner namespace and consent. Only an active local password account with no scoped binding and no retained Memoria identity may select the owner-bound master port. Disconnect, account deactivation/deletion and lookup errors fail closed, including for runtime ports created before the lifecycle change. These data requests authenticate with Memoria's owner-scoped master scheme, which validates the deployment secret but removes administrator authority before routing to memory handlers. Every request projects the authenticated Astra user as the Memoria owner; an unbound or incompatible backend fails closed. Memoria must contain the `Memoria-Owner` support introduced by `matrixorigin/Memoria#250` (not present in v0.5.1).

The background coordinator may launch a lightweight admission task, but it checks consent before loading snapshots, resolving an LLM, generating memory, or scheduling persistence. See [authentication](authentication.md) for issuer, credential replacement and retention.

MOI native UC uses the same resolver and consumers with an explicitly enabled
product-owned authority, not the local-password fallback or a second Memoria
login. Current UC status and canonical issuer mapping are checked for every
operation. Its bounded owner namespace and server-only credential are described
in [MOI native login](../guides/moi-native-login.md#built-in-memory). Automatic
prompt recall budgets both authorization and retrieval together; one successful
session-start lane remains usable if the other lane times out.

Optional reads report admission through the existing `MemoriaPort` read
operation, with one fresh authority resolution per operation and no discarded
read preflight. `Disabled` is quiet `NotAttempted`; `AuthorityUnavailable` and
`Failed` are `Unavailable`; successful empty reads are `Complete`. HTTP status
errors, including 401/403, are failed operations rather than inferred consent
denials. The shared absolute 750 ms prompt deadline covers authority and HTTP.
Snapshot reads quietly skip disabled memory; compaction takes its early local
fallback before summary generation for disabled or unavailable authority, while
transport failures retain downstream summary behavior. Cleanup maps every read
error to purge failure. Write admission before expensive work and fresh final
write checks remain required.

The bounded admitted authority-resolution counts are message recall 2 → 1,
session-start recall 3 → 2, snapshot loading 2 → 1, and applicable compaction
2 → 1. Independent session-start lanes deliberately resolve twice even when
disabled (previously one shared preflight), with zero backend requests. No
grant/client cache is shared between lanes or operations. These are source-level
operation counts, not predictions for whole-chat SQL totals.

Automatic prompt recall does not reuse candidates across primary-model request
preparations solely because the turn number and user message are unchanged.
Each preparation uses the existing current-authority admission and bounded
retrieval path; denial, lookup failure or timeout must not restore candidates
from an earlier preparation. Within one preparation, context-budget assembly and physical
provider retries may reuse its local retrieval result without starting another
retrieval. This avoids an unversioned cross-request cache; it does not promise atomic authorization
between an in-flight retrieval and the eventual model dispatch. Any future
asynchronous candidate selector must address that boundary explicitly before
retaining or reusing authorized snapshots.

## Learning boundary

Memory is not training data by default. Learning artifacts require consent, redaction, quality gate, lineage, and deletion propagation.

A memory retention request alone does not establish a durable Work task. A turn
that prohibits tools must not create Work through automatic admission. Ordinary
conversation-only acknowledgment needs no lookup or storage caveat. The compact
resident memory surface supports remember/recall; select the full memory contract
and use its invocation carrier for operations such as forget or update.
