# Permission sync

> Status: target design contract.

Permission sync defines how permission decisions remain consistent across Web, CLI, Edge, Server, MCP, and resumed sessions.

## Ownership

This document owns:

- permission grant shape;
- cross-surface permission propagation;
- local prompt vs cloud audit boundary;
- revocation and expiration;
- permission diagnostics.

Safety policy belongs to [safety-and-permissions.md](safety-and-permissions.md). Provider routing belongs to [capability-system.md](capability-system.md).

## Principle

```text
Permission is scoped authority, not a boolean remembered by the UI.
```

## Grant shape

A permission grant should record:

```text
grant_id
user_id
session_id
run_id
capability
tool_name
provider_id
resource_scope
action_scope
decision
expires_at
created_by_surface
audit_event_id
```

## Scope

Permission scope must be explicit:

- one tool call;
- current run;
- current session;
- workspace path prefix;
- command pattern;
- MCP server/tool;
- time-limited approval;
- deny rule.

## Cross-surface behavior

- Edge may collect local approval for local execution.
- Cloud must receive enough fact data to explain the decision later.
- Web should show pending approval state when Edge waits for local user input.
- Resume should not broaden old approvals.
- Revocation must prevent future dispatch even if a stale client UI says allowed.

## Plan mode

Plan mode denial is policy, not permission absence. Diagnostics should distinguish “permission missing” from “plan mode blocks mutation”.

## Revocation

Revocation should be durable and provider-visible. Revoked grants should not be silently re-enabled by reconnect or resume.

## Test obligations

- Approval scoped to one run does not leak to another run.
- Revocation wins over stale local state.
- Web can observe Edge waiting for permission.
- Plan mode denial is reported distinctly from permission denial.

## Runtime mode selection

Permission-mode selection is an authenticated Run control, separate from model
guidance. A request binds the expected Session and an idempotency key to a typed
mode. The durable journal assigns its revision. Only the owning user's active
root Run accepts requests; children retain inherited restrictions.

Before each model round, the shared loop captures the latest selection and
commits an application acknowledgement under the current owner generation.
Failure to commit prevents the model call. A request arriving during a round
cannot alter that round's captured policy. Recovery reapplies the durable
selection under the new owner generation. Selection never advances guidance
cursors or rewrites the stable prompt prefix or tool schema.

The ordered application event updates the CLI policy owner and its root sandbox
overlay before subsequent tool dispatch. Explicit skill restrictions remain in
force. TUI intent is pending until its exact request identity is acknowledged;
a delayed acknowledgement cannot erase a newer selection. When execution ends
before another model round, the selected preference applies to the next user
response. No session transcript is resumed implicitly.

When a selection arrives during an approval wait, execution supersedes unstarted
requests through the existing approval lifecycle and advances to the next model
round. Completed results are retained; running tools are not reauthorized.
The CLI stops the obsolete wait without posting a conflicting second approval
decision. A local acceptance notification wakes promptly; another device's
selection is discovered by bounded indexed reads only while approval is pending.
Closed waiters are removed from the TUI without manufacturing an approval.
