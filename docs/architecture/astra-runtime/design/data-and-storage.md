# Data and storage

> Status: target design contract.

Data and storage owns platform state layering, MatrixOne usage, retention, archival, versioning, and data correctness boundaries.

## State layers

| Layer | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| C0 control | sessions, runs, tasks, checkpoints, leases, execution slots. |
| C1 transcript | user-visible messages and transcript items. |
| C2 audit facts | durable events, permissions, provider decisions. |
| C3 trace facts | execution trace and diagnostic events. |
| C4 debug bundle | short-lived raw diagnostics and manifests. |
| C5 learning artifacts | redacted, consent-gated derived data. |

## MatrixOne role

MatrixOne is the platform state store and analytic substrate. It should support:

- durable runtime state;
- indexed transcript and event queries;
- audit and replay;
- retention and purge jobs;
- analytic/evaluation workloads;
- optional MatrixOne-native value such as time travel or hybrid search when appropriate.

## Schema bootstrap

Bootstrap supports a fresh database or the current schema contract. Canonical
CREATE declarations define the complete table shape; startup validates it
without ALTER-based upgrades, historical backfills, or retired-table cleanup.
An older completion marker is rejected and requires a new database. Interrupted
fresh bootstrap can retry under the existing database lease, with readiness
published only after schema validation succeeds.

## Transcript persistence

Fresh schema contract `2026-09-22-v89` stores transcript items and their
committed projection head. Physical page metadata and the unused source event
position column are removed. The run lookup index is `(user_id, run_id)`.
There is no migration, replacement table, page cache, or rebuild job.

One append implementation requires canonical session admission in the same
transaction. Canonical/core event writers reuse their admission; standalone
append and evidence materialization acquire `admit_session_event_write(false)`,
including reasoning-only and cursor-only materialization. Empty append executes
no SQL; all-replay append does not allocate a sequence. New identities use one
lazy `MAX(item_seq)` under the owner/session lock. Membership and insert batches
are limited by bind count and payload bytes; an indivisible oversized item is
sent alone. Database column equality determines duplicate identities within
and across batches. First occurrence wins; equal content under distinct IDs
remains distinct. All chunks and enclosing event capture roll back together.

Item content hashes, per-item canonical commitment fields, contiguous committed
projection heads, and authoritative terminal replay verification remain
required. Accepted event replay can repair missing display material and enrich
reasoning; it cannot reconstruct arbitrary original item sequences/timestamps
or synthesize a committed head from the newest item. The bounded root-only
transcript restore fallback remains available when canonical history is absent.

## Retention

Retention is a product contract:

- C0 follows account/session policy.
- C1 follows user history policy.
- C2 follows audit policy and may archive.
- C3 follows diagnosis window and may compact.
- C4 has short TTL and explicit enablement.
- C5 follows consent, lineage, and deletion propagation.

## Correctness

- Event ids should be stable and collision-resistant.
- Ingestion should be idempotent.
- Session event counters commit in the same transaction as their inserted event
  rows, including terminal settlement and trace repair. Replay contributes no
  insertion delta; a lost commit acknowledgement must not trigger a separate
  counter update.
- Terminal capture batches core conversation events and LLM/tool trace events
  through the same writer, sharing session admission and insertion readback.
- Poison records should be isolated.
- Invalid records should not block later independent facts.
- Slot/lease semantics must avoid permanent deadlock through expiry or repair.
- Run mutations retain the deletion-fence → session → execution-slot → run
  lock order. A caller's exact-owner/session/run locking read also establishes
  existence; it does not need a separate existence query in that transaction.
- Data deletion must propagate to derived artifacts.
- Decision audits and skill selections acquire canonical non-lazy session
  admission in the same transaction as INSERT. Decision reference checks and
  receipt decoding complete before commit; a receipt failure rolls back the
  insert. Skill catalog resolution precedes BEGIN and the first selected
  skill's resolved version is bound in INSERT, retaining the supplied version
  when unresolved. Neither path allocates sequences or changes event counters;
  an empty skill hook performs no database I/O. Their checked-out connection is
  released only after completed commit or rollback; cancellation closes that
  checkout. A lost commit acknowledgement still has an unknown outcome.

## Versioning

Versioning is used for reproducibility and experimentation, not as a substitute for audit facts.

A reconstructable decision needs:

- prompt/context version;
- memory snapshot or references;
- provider decision facts;
- transcript and trace facts;
- model and parameter metadata.

## Agent event retention

Agent events must have explicit retention class.

Suggested retention classes:

| Class | Examples | Policy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| control_audit | permission, provider decision, run transition | account/audit policy. |
| trace_default | tool lifecycle, retry/cache/sync facts | diagnosis window, then archive/compact. |
| quality_signal | tool quality, eval labels | learning/eval policy after redaction. |
| debug_ref | debug artifact references | follows debug bundle TTL. |
| ephemeral_metric | high-volume counters | aggregate then expire. |

Missing retention class should fail safe by applying a bounded default, not infinite retention.

## Poison and quarantine storage

Invalid or conflicting records should move to quarantine with:

```text
quarantine_id
source
session_id
run_id
event_id
payload_hash
reason
raw_ref_or_summary
repair_options
created_at
expires_at
```

Quarantine must be observable and repairable. It must not block independent valid facts.

## Archival and deletion

Archival should preserve allowed metadata while removing or redacting payloads according to policy. Deletion must propagate to:

- transcript-derived memory;
- learning datasets;
- debug bundles;
- artifact manifests;
- eval cases that include private payloads.
